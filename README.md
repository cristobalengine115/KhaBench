# KhaBench

KhaBench is a benchmark for Multimodal Database Management Systems (MMDBMS). Its primary goal is to compare the performance and metrics of different MMDBMS in a distributed architecture. This tool is designed to facilitate the evaluation of various database systems that support multiple data models and workloads, providing insights into their strengths and limitations in real-world distributed environments.

## Features

- **Multi-model Support**: KhaBench is capable of benchmarking MMDBMS that support a variety of data models such as relational, document, key-value, and graph databases.
- **Distributed Architecture**: The benchmark is specifically designed to work in distributed database environments, offering insights into scalability, latency, and throughput.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Measure a wide range of metrics such as query performance, data consistency, transaction throughput, and system resource utilization.
- **Customization**: Flexible configuration to adjust workloads, data sizes, and node setups, allowing comparisons between different configurations and database systems.
- **Compatibility**: Supports multiple popular MMDBMS implementations, making it easy to test a range of database systems.
